            <h3>Bubble Sort</h3>
            <p>
              Bubblesort works in passes through the structure that holds the
              elements. During a pass, the algorithm starts at one end (let's
              say the left end) and works its way through each position of the
              structure. At each position, it tests whether the current
              element and its neighbor are correctly ordered. If that is not
              the case, the elements are swapped.
            </p>
            <p>
              Note that after the first pass, the largest element will be at
              the very right, where it belongs. This is true because at each
              position, the larger of both elements is either on the right, or
              it gets swapped (to the right). At some point during the first
              pass, the largest element must be swapped with some neighbour on
              its right (unless it already happens to be the right-most
              element). This then repeats. The largest element will swap
              position with each of the remaining element, as they will all be
              smaller. It doesn so until it reaches the right-most position.
            </p>
            <p>
              These procedure is then repeated. In the second pass, the second
              largest element will end up being the second to last element on
              the right, etc. Note that each pass is one element shorter than
              the previous one. Since after the i-th pass, the i-th largest
              element is correctly placed i positions from the right, they no
              longer need to be compared.
            </p>
            <p>
              This notion of letting the largest elements incrementally rise
              to their correct place to the right is what gives the algorithm
              its name. The largest elements "bubble up" through the structure
              at every pass.

            <h3>Insertion Sort</h3>
            <p>
              As the name suggests, insertion sort looks at every element in a
              structure and, one by one, "inserts" these elements in the right
              place.
            </p>
            <p>
              The way an element is inserted is simple. Assuming a sorting
              from left to right, an element is swapped with a left neighbors
              for as long as it is smaller than that left neighbor. For any
              given element, this will move it to a spot where it is correctly
              placed. I.e., where it has a smaller neighbor to its left.
            </p>
            <p>
              Doing this with each element will result in a structure where
              each element is as left as possible. Or in other words, every
              element has only smaller elements to the left. The array is
              therefore sorted.
